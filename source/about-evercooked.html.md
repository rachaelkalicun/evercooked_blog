	<p>Welcome to Evercooked! I'm Rachael Kalicun, and I'm celebrating food as the bridge that connects generations, cultures, and experiences. Cooking is an act of love that honors the past, strengthens bonds, and creates memories that last long after the meal is over.</p>

	<p>Together, we'll explore meaningful dishes, traditions, and the cultural significance behind what we cook. As we grow in the kitchen, we'll deepen our connection to the meals we create and the stories they carry.</p>

	<p>Let's honor traditions, create new ones, and build lasting connections. Grab a seat at the table, and let's cook together.</p>
