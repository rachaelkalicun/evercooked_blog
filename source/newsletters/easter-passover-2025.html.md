### A time for pausing, remembering, and starting fresh.

Today and this week hold deep meaning across traditions. It‚Äôs Good Friday, a solemn pause before Easter‚Äôs celebration on Sunday, and it‚Äôs also the middle of Passover. While I didn‚Äôt grow up celebrating Passover, I‚Äôm honoring both holidays through food, reflection, and the people I‚Äôve shared the table with.

I cooked three dishes that carry meaning in different ways: two are traditions I‚Äôve chosen to continue, and one that was new to me. Each one reminded me that tradition can be both inherited and created, and that putting in the effort, even when the results aren‚Äôt guaranteed, is always worthwhile.

## Palm Sunday Parmatieddi Pasta

I didn‚Äôt grow up with a Palm Sunday food tradition, but this year I wanted to start one. I made parmatieddi, a hand-rolled pasta from Teggiano in southern Italy. The shape is meant to resemble palm leaves to honor Palm Sunday, the day that marks Jesus‚Äôs entry into Jerusalem and begins Holy Week, the seven days leading up to Easter. The name (parma, meaning palm) refers either to the day itself or to the shape of the pasta.

As someone who married into a family with Italian roots, it felt like a meaningful way to connect with that heritage.

It didn‚Äôt go as planned. The dough was too dry, the pasta stayed firm, and mine didn‚Äôt look like palm leaves at all. For a moment, I didn‚Äôt want to write about it, but these are the stories that really matter. Not every dish feels like a win. Sometimes just trying is the most meaningful part. If we only share the polished moments, we lose what makes cooking so powerful: its honesty, intention, and humility.

Even though it‚Äôs Lent, parmatieddi is traditionally served with a rich meat ragu, a celebratory meal before the fast and quiet of Good Friday. That part was a total win. The meat sauce was rich, slow-cooked, and really satisfying.

There‚Äôs value in honoring new traditions, even when they‚Äôre imperfect. That‚Äôs the spirit behind Evercooked. It‚Äôs about making space for intention over perfection.

## Good Friday Sourdough Hot Cross Buns, Two Ways

![Raisin and chocolate sourdough hot cross buns](/images/pre-easter-2025/sourdough-hot-cross-buns.jpg)

Hot cross buns are a small nod to British tradition that my husband grew up with. I always make two versions for Easter: one with the traditional raisins, and one with chunks of chocolate. They‚Äôre soft, fragrant, and so good warm from the oven. Easter celebrates rebirth and resurrection, and these buns always feel like a fresh start after a long winter.

## Passover Matzo Ball Soup

Passover commemorates the Jewish people‚Äôs liberation from slavery in Egypt. When I was younger, I lived with a Jewish family for a while and absorbed some of their traditions. One member of that family is still in my life and a reader of this newsletter. That connection means a lot to me.

This week I made matzo ball soup: clear broth and gentle dumplings. It‚Äôs a meal that always carries memory in every spoonful. It‚Äôs not a tradition I inherited, but it‚Äôs one I continue to honor.

## What We Carry Forward

Whether you‚Äôre celebrating Easter, Passover, or simply sensing the season shift (even though it‚Äôs currently snowing in Colorado!), this is a time that invites reflection. What traditions do we inherit? Which ones do we build? What do we try, even when the result isn‚Äôt guaranteed?

Here at Evercooked, we carry forward:

- Creativity and courage in the kitchen
- An appreciation for food as memory
- The belief that trying is a form of honoring
- The reminder that we can always try again, in cooking and in life

If you‚Äôre exploring a tradition this week, trying something new, or reviving an old favorite, I‚Äôd love to hear about it. Share your story with the Evercooked community using **#evercooked**.
