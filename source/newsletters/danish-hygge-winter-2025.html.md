Spring is officially here, but I’m still holding onto a little hygge (pronounced "HOO-guh")—Denmark’s way of finding warmth, comfort, and connection. In these early days of the season, there’s still space to slow down, get cozy, and reconnect through cooking.

My grandmother’s Danish roots connect me to a heritage I hadn’t explored until now. While I haven’t been to Scandinavia yet, learning about its traditions, especially hygge, has offered a glimpse into my family’s past.

What better way to experience a culture than through its food? With no prior experience in Danish cooking, I took the plunge and tried making some classic recipes. Some dishes turned out great, and others were learning experiences. That’s all part of finding confidence and meaning in the kitchen.

If you’ve ever been curious about Danish cuisine, consider this an invitation to explore it with me! Here are a few dishes I made to experience hygge firsthand, and each one brought me closer to the tradition.

## Baking Rugbrod: A Taste of the Past

Rugbrød, Danish for rye bread (“rug” means rye, “brød” means bread), is a dense, seeded, fermented loaf with deep, earthy flavors and a tangy sourness. It’s the foundation for smørrebrød, Denmark’s beloved open-faced sandwiches.

You can find my rugbrød recipe [here](/blog/rugbrod).

## Smorrebrod: Simple, Satisfying, and Versatile

To make smørrebrød, just spread butter on a slice of rugbrød (or any good bread!) and layer it with traditional ingredients such as pickled herring, cheese, meats, or eggs. You can also experiment with modern toppings. There’s no right or wrong way to make it your own. Play with flavors, try unexpected combinations, and trust your instincts in the kitchen.

I’ve put together a few ideas [here](/blog/beet-salmon-potato-egg-smorrebrod).

## A Cozy Drink to Warm the Soul: Classic Glogg

Gløgg (pronounced "gluhg") is a warm, spiced mulled wine that’s perfect for chilly days. Made with red wine, sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom, its comforting flavor instantly evokes coziness. Traditionally, raisins and slivered almonds are added, enhancing both the flavor and texture.

As with most recipes, there’s no need for perfection. If you don’t have all the exact ingredients, get creative with what you have. You really can’t go wrong with warm, sweet, infused wine!

## A Sweet Finish and a New Adventure: Aebleskiver

Aebleskiver (pronounced 'AY-bluh-skee-vuh,' with a soft 'v' sound, almost like a 'w' sound) are traditional Danish pancake balls: light and fluffy on the inside, crisp on the outside, and often dusted with powdered sugar or filled with sweet fillings.

The name translates to “apple slices” because they were originally stuffed with apples. Today in Denmark, they’re mostly made plain and served with jam. To make them, I treated myself to a special pan that shapes the batter into perfect little rounds. They’re a perfect cozy-day treat, especially with a cup of hot gløgg.

## Cooking is About Joy, Growth, and Exploration

As we step into spring, let’s take a moment to carry forward the rituals that bring meaning to our kitchens. I hope you’ll try baking some Danish treats and embrace the spirit of hygge along the way. Slow down, enjoy the moment, and nourish both your body and soul.

Traditions, whether passed down through generations or newly discovered, give us a sense of connection to the past and shape our present. As we explore new recipes and our family histories, we’re also creating our own traditions and keeping the joy of cooking alive.

Evercooked is here to help reclaim meaningful cooking from disconnection in the kitchen, one homemade meal, shared story, and rediscovered tradition at a time.
