Traditions often connect us to our heritage, but we also have the power to create our own. Whether inherited or self-made, they matter. When we cook together or share a dish at the table, we strengthen bonds that go beyond what we're eating.

Each year, as Lent approaches, I acknowledge the occasion with two meals: one for Mardi Gras and another for Shrove Tuesday. This year, they fall on March 4 (tomorrow).

Although I don’t have ties to New Orleans, I’ve created my own Mardi Gras celebration. My husband, on the other hand, grew up in England and introduced me to Shrove Tuesday pancakes. Over time, these traditions, one adopted and one inherited, have become part of our shared story.

### Bringing Mardi Gras to the Table

Each year, my Mardi Gras ritual helps shake off the post-Christmas blues. The sound of jazz in the background reminds me that spring is near. I always look forward to this meal.

#### Gumbo: Stirring Up Tradition with a Perfect Roux

Making gumbo starts with the roux. It takes time and patience to reach a rich, dark chocolate brown. Mixing flour and oil for 30 minutes can seem tedious, but like anything worthwhile, persistence pays off. Time and hard work create depth, both for the roux and in life.

I don’t use a recipe, but I’ve written out the details [here](/blog/gumbo).

#### Sourdough Beignets: A Sweet Tradition with Café au Lait

Making beignets is as comforting as eating them, and as a coffee lover, I can't imagine them without chicory-laced café au lait. The combination is simple yet perfect. [Click here for the beignet recipe](/blog/sourdough-beignets) and [click here for the café au lait recipe](/blog/cafe-au-lait).

#### King Cake: A Festive Twist with Sourdough

The vibrant purple, green, and gold of a king cake capture the spirit of Mardi Gras. It’s a celebration in every slice.

### Shrove Tuesday: A British Tradition

Shrove Tuesday is a time to use up rich ingredients before Lent begins, but for my husband, it’s also a link to his childhood. Flipping pancakes with a flick of the wrist (sometimes missing the pan entirely) keeps the tradition playful. By making them together, we connect the past to the present, turning a simple ritual into a shared experience.

#### Pancakes: The British Version

In the UK, Shrove Tuesday is all about pancakes, but not the thick, fluffy versions with maple syrup that Americans might expect. Instead, these are thin crepe-like pancakes.

I make savory ones for dinner. The vegetarian ones are filled with sautéed spinach, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and goat cheese. The meat ones are usually filled with ham, brie, and cornichons.

For dessert, the classic British version is simply topped with lemon juice and sugar. I also make a chocolate option with bananas and toasted walnuts.

This simple, versatile dish connects us to family traditions and gives us a chance to create our own memories.

### What Are Your Pre-Lenten Traditions?

Do you celebrate Mardi Gras, Shrove Tuesday, or have another pre-Lenten tradition? I’d love to hear about your traditions, whether they’re passed down or newly created. Share your story with the Evercooked community or reply to this email.

### A Final Thought

Evercooked isn’t just about food. It’s about the connections we create when we cook. Every time you step into the kitchen, you contribute to something bigger than a single meal.

As we celebrate Mardi Gras and Shrove Tuesday, remember that food bridges generations, cultures, and histories. It holds stories. It carries legacies.

Keep cooking, keep sharing, and keep passing your traditions forward.
