Every year, I make two festive meals to mark the day before Lent (March 4 this year). One is for Mardi Gras, and the other is for Shrove Tuesday (discussed next time).

I don't have ties to New Orleans, but that hasn't stopped me from creating my own Mardi Gras celebration. Although traditions are often connected to our heritage, we also have the power to create our own. Self-made traditions are fun, and when we share special meals, we strengthen our bonds.

Every year, my Mardi Gras traditions chase away the post-Christmas blues. Jazz in the background signifies that spring is right around the corner. It's a festive meal I always look forward to.

## Gumbo: Stir Away Your Worries with a Perfect Roux

Gumbo is simple, but stirring the roux until it's dark brown takes patience and endurance. I put on some moody music and cook equal parts flour and oil for 30 minutes or so, stirring continuously, being careful not to burn it. It's a meditative process.

When the roux looks chocolatey, I add the New Orleans "holy trinity" of onions, celery, and peppers. Then, I toss in garlic, chilies, and spices: bay leaves, cayenne pepper, oregano, and thyme. Finally, I add some stock and a few canned tomatoes (Creole style) and the okra.

To make it vegetarian for my spouse, I’ll add some sautéed fake meat: Quorn ChiQin and vegetarian sausage. For my own meat version, I'll add sautéed sausage and, at the very end, shrimp.

I serve it in a bowl with filé powder on top and sometimes rice.

I don’t use a recipe, but I’ve written out the details.

## Beignets with Café au Lait

Making beignets is as comforting as the result. I mix flour, sourdough starter, sugar, and warm milk into a soft dough, letting it ferment overnight.

I roll out the dough, cut it into squares, and deep-fry them until golden and puffy. A very generous dusting of powdered sugar is the finishing touch.

For the café au lait, I brew strong coffee and roasted chicory in a French press. Then I mix it with sweet, hot milk and serve it in a bowl.

The pairing is simple but perfect.

## King Cake

Making king cake offers the reward of a festive and colorful sweet bread. I mix flour, sugar, sourdough starter, and warm milk into a soft dough, letting it ferment overnight.

I roll it out, spread a cinnamon-sugar filling, roll it up, and then shape it into a ring before baking until golden. Once cooled, I drizzle on a sweet glaze and sprinkle it with purple, green, and gold sugar, the colors of Mardi Gras.

## New Orleans: A City of Music, Tradition, and Resilience

New Orleans has a uniqueness shaped by music, tradition, and resilience. The city clings to its culture, which binds it together through hard times. Through its example, we can learn valuable lessons as we build our own connections and traditions.

At home, my Mardi Gras meal is always paired with New Orleans jazz to set the mood and honor the culture.

## Cookbook Adventure: Exploring a Tradition Through Food

Despite your cooking experience, there are always ways to grow. That's why for each issue, I will explore a cookbook and make a dish I've never made before. This time it's New Orleans Jambalaya for Cooking for New Orleans.

I challenge you to make it too. Get the book from Amazon or your library. Let me know how it goes.

## Join the Evercooked Conversation

I’d love to hear about a dish that is special to you. It could be your grandmother's soup, a holiday tradition, or even a recipe you are trying for the first time. Share your recipes and memories using #evercooked or reply to this email. Your story might be featured in an upcoming issue!

## A Closing Thought

As we begin this journey, I hope you find as much joy in connecting over food and stories as I have. Food nourishes our bodies and souls, builds communities, and nurtures legacies. When you cook, you're contributing to something bigger than the meal itself.

As we celebrate Mardi Gras, remember that food is a powerful connector. It bridges generations, cultures, and histories.

Keep cooking, sharing, and passing on your traditions. Let your kitchen be the place where love, resilience, and joy are served in every dish.

With love,
