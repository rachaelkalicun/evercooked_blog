  - "Prepare the Protein: While the gumbo cooks, sauté the vegetarian meat if using until browned. If making the meat version, sauté the sausage."
  - "Finish & Serve: Stir the protein into the gumbo and let everything meld for 15 minutes. If using shrimp, add at the very end and let cook just until pink. Serve in bowls with a sprinkle of filé powder on top and a scoop of rice if you want."

# The Meditative Art of Making Gumbo: A Rich, Flavorful Tradition

Gumbo is a simple dish, but like many things worth pursuing, it demands patience and perseverance. Cooking the roux until it's dark brown is the key to a flavorful gumbo, and that takes a bit of brawn.

Put on some music, find a rhythm, and let the stir become a quiet meditation. Watching the color of the roux develop is magical.

**This recipe is a guide.** There's plenty of room to improvise with what you have on hand and to your taste. You are unique and so is your gumbo.

### **1. Make the Roux**
Put on your favorite music.

In a heavy pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the flour and stir continuously with a wooden spoon or whisk.

Keep stirring for about 30 minutes. It will change from blonde to peanut-butter brown to dark-chocolate brown. Be careful not to burn it.

### **2. Build the Gumbo**
Add the onions, celery, and bell pepper to the roux. Stir well and let the vegetables soften for about 5 minutes.

Add the garlic, chilies (if using), and spices. Cook for another minute until fragrant.

### **3. Simmer the Gumbo**
Pour in the stock and add the tomatoes and okra.

Bring it to a gentle simmer and let it cook for 30 minutes to an hour.

Stir occasionally so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.

### **4. Prepare the Protein**
While the gumbo cooks, sauté the vegetarian meat if using until browned. If making the meat version, sauté the sausage.

### **5. Finish & Serve**
Stir the protein into the gumbo and let everything meld for 15 minutes. If using shrimp, add at the very end and let cook just until pink.

Serve in bowls with a sprinkle of filé powder on top and a scoop of rice if you want.
