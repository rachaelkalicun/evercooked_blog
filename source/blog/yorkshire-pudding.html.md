Yorkshire pudding is a beloved part of the traditional British Sunday roast, a delightfully airy invention made from a simple batter of eggs, milk, and flour. Baked in hot oil until crisp and golden, it’s typically served with roast meat and gravy.

The goal is to get them to rise tall and puffy, but that’s easier said than done. I don’t get the result I hope for every time. In fact, I probably have about a 50% success rate, but that’s part of pushing yourself in the kitchen and in life.

I make mine in a standard muffin tin, using canola oil and whatever milk I have on hand. I let the batter rest for at least an hour, heat the oil until it’s very hot, and don’t dare open the oven door. Even with all the “right” steps, success isn’t guaranteed, and that’s exactly why it matters.

This recipe isn’t just about a side dish. It’s about sticking with something that takes perseverance. It’s about doing something worthwhile even when the outcome is unpredictable.

This version makes six or seven tall, golden Yorkshire puddings, depending on how full you fill each cup in a standard muffin tin.

- 4 eggs
- 1 1/2 cups (355 ml) milk (any kind)
- 1 1/4 cups (156 g) all-purpose flour

## How to Make Yorkshire Puddings

### **1. Blend the Batter**
In a blender, combine the eggs, milk, flour, salt, black pepper, and any optional spices. Blend until smooth. Let the batter rest at room temperature for at least one hour.

### **2. Preheat the Oven and Heat the Oil**
Preheat the oven to 425°F. Add about 1 tablespoon of canola oil to seven wells of a muffin tin. Place the tin on the top rack and heat for at least 30 minutes, until the oil is very hot.

### **3. Pour the Batter**
Carefully remove the hot tin from the oven. Working very quickly so that the batter hits the hottest oil possible, pour the batter into each well, filling about 3/4 of the way full. It should sizzle immediately.

### **4. Bake Without Peeking**
Return the tin to the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Do not open the oven door until at least 15 minutes have passed.

### **5. Serve Immediately**
The puddings should be puffed, golden, and crisp. Serve them hot with meat, gravy, and your favorite sides.
