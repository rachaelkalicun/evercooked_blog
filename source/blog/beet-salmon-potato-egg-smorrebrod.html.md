The freedom to create is what I love most about cooking, and this dish is an invitation to play with flavors, textures, and traditions. Smørrebrød is a Danish classic, an open-faced sandwich built on a tangy foundation of [rugbrød](https://www.evercooked.com/blog/rugbrod) (dense, dark rye bread). Although it's a Danish tradition, how you make smørrebrød is up to you. It can be as traditional or inventive as you want, as almost all dishes can be. Pickled herring, meats, and cheeses reflect the classic approach, but there are endless combinations to explore.

The beauty of smørrebrød lies in its flexibility. Don't worry about the rugbrød part. Any good bread will work! The key is balance: contrasting textures, vibrant flavors, thoughtful layering, and a mix of colors. Take what you have and turn it into something delicious. A well-made dish is a story shaped by history, personal taste, and some improvisation.

Today, I’m sharing three variations I made, including two vegetarian ones, along with a bright dill and horseradish cream sauce to tie them together. Use it as is, adjust it to your liking, or leave it out completely. The best meals are the ones that feel like your own.

Beets reward an open mind. The more I cook with them, the more I appreciate their sweet earthiness. In this smørrebrød, they take center stage with tangy goat cheese and chunky chickpeas. Dill and cucumber bring a fresh contrast. If you’ve ever been on the fence about beets, consider this an invitation to rethink them!

It’s comforting to recognize flavors, no matter where they come from. This creamy sauce pairs perfectly with any of the smørrebrød variations, adding a tangy, rich flavor.
