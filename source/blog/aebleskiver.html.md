Cooking is about making space to try something new, with no certainty of the result, and Danish æbleskiver are a perfect example. These soft, airy Danish pancake balls are a staple in Denmark at Christmastime, often enjoyed with [gløgg](/blog/glogg), Denmark’s warm, spiced wine. Made in a special æbleskive pan, they blend tradition with playful technique. [Buying the pan](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZUAFL4){:target="_blank"} feels like a small indulgence, and it's a fun investment in discovering a new technique.

Making æbleskiver is all about movement. The batter sets on one side before being nudged over, allowing more batter to be added to complete the turn. A fork works, but instinctively, fingers often find their way in, even though it's a little warm to the touch. Extra butter midway deepens the golden crust, adding a satisfying crispness that contrasts with the soft, airy center.

The process becomes rhythmic, one of those cooking moments where making is as enjoyable as eating. Hot off the pan, æbleskiver are perfect with chocolate sauce or strawberry jam, but, like most dishes, there’s room to make them your own.

Trying new things in the kitchen isn’t just about food. It’s about being curious, trusting yourself through new techniques, and treating yourself to the small joys of discovery. Whether it’s a new dish, a new tool, or simply exploring a familiar tradition in a new way, those little moments of exploration make cooking, and life, more satisfying.

### **3. Cook the First Side**
Spoon batter into each well, filling to the top. Allow the batter to cook until the edges begin to set.

### **4. Rotate and Add More Batter**
Use a fork and your fingers to rotate each æbleskiver about 90 degrees. Add a little more batter into the gap before rotating the cooked side fully to the top. Press down gently to help form the round shape.

### **5. Brown Evenly**
Add a bit more butter to the pan as you rotate them, helping the bottom side brown evenly.
