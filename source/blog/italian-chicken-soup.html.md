This Italian chicken soup is one of the best examples of how far one good meal can stretch. Buying a whole chicken, roasting it, and then turning the bones and scraps into soup is comforting and smart and frugal. I get two of my favorite meals out of one chicken. I always make soup after roasting a chicken.

The beauty of making chicken soup is how simple it is. There's no perfect technique. I just throw everything into the pot and pretty much forget about it. You can simmer it slowly, walk away, and come back to something gorgeous.

I learned this kind of soup from my Calabrian mother-in-law. When I once suggested we make chicken soup, she immediately reached for tomatoes. That hadn't been on my radar before.

What makes this version feel especially Italian is the orzo and the base of garlic and herbs: dried basil, oregano, rosemary, and parsley. Tomatoes add brightness, and if I have one, I'll toss in a Parmesan rind. It adds a richness that feels distinctly Italian. The result is a nourishing, soothing meal.

If you've roasted a chicken recently, you're halfway there. Let the chicken do the work. This recipe is really just a technique. Start with a leftover chicken. Make a broth. Add what you have. Make it your own.

Need a roast chicken recipe to start with? Here's one I like: [Buttermilk Roast Chicken](/blog/buttermilk-marinated-roast-chicken). If you don't have buttermilk or don't have time to marinate the chicken, just roast the chicken simply with salt. You'll still get a great result with almost no effort.

Soup like this is more than a meal. It’s a way of showing care (even to yourself), using what you have, and honoring the traditions of home cooking. It may start with leftovers, but it ends with something full of warmth and intention.

## How to Make Italian Chicken Soup

### **1. Make the Broth**
This part is easy: I throw everything into the pot. Add the chicken bones and skin, onion, garlic, dried herbs, parsley, and Parmesan rind if using. Toss in the carrots, celery, and tomatoes. (If you prefer your vegetables less soft, you can wait and add them later.) Cover everything with water, add some salt and pepper, and bring it to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and let it cook for about 2 hours. Stir a few times.

### **2. Remove Bones and Optionally Add the Vegetables**
Use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the bones, skin, and Parmesan rind. Taste the broth. It should already be rich and aromatic. If you waited to add the vegetables earlier, add them now and simmer until tender, about 15–20 minutes.

### **3. Add the Orzo and Chicken**
Stir in the orzo and cook for about 5 minutes. Then add the shredded chicken and cook until everything is heated through and the orzo is tender. Season with more salt and pepper to taste.

Finish with a squeeze of lemon and a sprinkle of fresh parsley. If you'd like, stir in a handful of baby spinach just before serving to let it wilt into the soup.
