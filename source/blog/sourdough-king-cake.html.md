ingredients:
  - 160 g (1/2 cup) milk
  - 113 g (1/2 cup) unsalted butter
  - 1 large egg + 2 large egg yolks
  - 100 g (3/4 cup) bubbly, active sourdough starter
  - 24 g (2 tbsp) sugar
  - 300 g (21/2 cups) all-purpose flour
  - 3 g (1/2 tsp) salt
  - Oil, for the bowl
  - 28 g (2 tbsp) butter, melted (for brushing)
  - Colored sugar or icing for decoration (optional)
  - 120 g (1 cup) powdered sugar
  - 1–2 tbsp milk or heavy cream
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - 1/2 cup granulated sugar
  - Food coloring
cuisine: Cajun, Creole

instructions:
  - Feed your sourdough starter the day before baking to make sure it’s bubbly and active.
  - Warm the milk and 85 g (6 tbsp) butter in a small saucepan or microwave. Let cool slightly.
  - Add the egg, egg yolks, sourdough starter, and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix to combine. Slowly pour in the warm milk mixture. Add flour and salt, mixing until a rough dough forms. Cover with a damp towel and rest for 30 minutes.
  - Knead on medium-low speed for 6 to 8 minutes. Adjust with flour if too sticky. The dough should be soft, smooth, and slightly tacky.
  - Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rise at room temperature for 8 to 10 hours (or overnight).
  - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Let it rest for 5–10 minutes. Roll into a 15 x 10-inch  rectangle. Roll it into a tight log, seam side down, and shape into a ring. Let rest for 10–15 minutes.
  - Brush with melted butter. Cover and let rise until puffy, about 1 hour.
  - "Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 20–25 minutes, then reduce to 350°F (180°C) for 10–15 more minutes. The cake should be golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped."
  - Once cooled, decorate with glaze and colored sugar.

King Cake is a celebration of tradition and community. In New Orleans, people eat it from January 6, known as Epiphany, which marks the day the three wise men visited baby Jesus. The tradition continues until Mardi Gras. A plastic baby is hidden inside, and whoever finds it is said to be blessed with luck and prosperity.

Today, there are many variations, like cinnamon-sugar or cream cheese fillings. I kept this one traditional. It's a simple brioche dough, decorated with the symbolic colors of purple, green, and gold. Purple stands for justice, green represents faith, and gold signifies power.

Like all yeast-based baking in my household, I use a sourdough starter. It adds depth and tang, and it’s a practical choice since I already have the starter.

Make it your own. While I kept it simple, feel free to add fillings like cinnamon-sugar with pecans, jam, or cream cheese. You can also knead cinnamon into the dough.

Baking is about enjoying the process. Your dough might not rise as expected, or the glaze could be messy. That’s all part of it. Every time you bake, you gain skills and confidence. You also create traditions that last with you and your loved ones.

## Instructions

### **1. Feed Your Starter**
Feed your sourdough starter the day before baking to make sure it’s bubbly and active.

### **2. Make the Dough**
Warm the milk and 85 g (6 tbsp) of butter in a small saucepan or microwave. Let it cool slightly.

Add the egg, egg yolks, sourdough starter, and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix to combine. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the warm milk mixture. Add the flour and salt, mixing until a rough dough forms, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Cover with a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.

### **3. Knead the Dough**
Knead on medium-low speed for about 6 to 8 minutes or until the dough separates from the sides and bottom of the bowl. The dough should be soft, smooth, and slightly tacky. If it’s too sticky, sprinkle a bit more flour to adjust the consistency.

### **4. Bulk Rise**
Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 8 to 10 hours (or overnight).

### **5. Shape the Dough**
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.

Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Let it rest for 5–10 minutes. Roll the dough into a large rectangle, about 15 x 10 inches (38 x 25 cm). Roll it into a tight log, seam side down. Transfer to your prepared sheet pan, shaping it into a ring. Let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes.

### **6. Second Rise**
Brush the surface and sides of the dough with melted butter. Cover and let rest until puffy, about 1 hour.

### **7. Bake the Brioche**
Place the cake in the preheated oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown. You can optionally cover with a large roasting pan, sprayed with water, to provide a moist environment. Reduce the heat to 350°F (180°C), remove the cover if using, and continue baking for another 10 to 15 minutes. The cake should be golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped.

### **8. Decorate & Serve**
Once the cake has cooled, you can decorate it with a glaze and colored sugar. I brush the bread again with melted butter, drizzle on some glaze, pat on the sugar, and drizzle with glaze again!

## How to Make Colored Sugar
1. Combine regular granulated sugar with a few drops of food coloring.
2. Stir until the sugar is evenly colored. You can also shake the sugar and food coloring together in a small resealable bag.
3. Let it dry for 10 minutes before using.

## How to Make the Glaze
1. In a small bowl, whisk together 120 g (1 cup) powdered sugar with 1–2 tbsp milk to reach your desired consistency.
2. Add 1 tsp of vanilla extract for flavor.
3. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake.
