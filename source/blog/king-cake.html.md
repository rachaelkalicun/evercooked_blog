  - 1 large egg + 2 large egg yolks
  - 100 g (¾ cup) bubbly, active sourdough starter
  - 24 g (2 tbsp) sugar
  - 300 g (21/2 cups) all-purpose flour
  - 3 g (1/2 tsp) fine sea salt
  - Oil, for coating

  - 1–2 tbsp milk or heavy cream
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - 1/2 cup granulated sugar

cuisine: Cajun, Creole

instructions:
  - Feed your starter a few days before baking to ensure it’s bubbly and active. Store at room temperature until ready.
  - Warm the milk and 85 g (6 tbsp) butter in a small saucepan or microwave. Let cool slightly.
  - Add the egg, egg yolks, sourdough starter, and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix to combine using the paddle attachment. Slowly pour in the warm milk mixture. Add flour and salt, mixing  until a rough dough forms. Cover with a damp towel and rest for 30 minutes.
  - Switch to the dough hook and knead on medium-low speed for 6 to 8 minutes. Adjust with flour if too sticky. The dough should be soft, smooth, and slightly tacky.
  - Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rise at room temperature for 8 to 10 hours (or overnight).
  - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Remove the dough onto a lightly oiled surface, rest for 5–10 minutes. Roll into a 15 x 10-inch  rectangle. Roll it into a tight log, seam side down, and shape into a ring. Let rest for 10–15 minutes.
  - Brush with melted butter. Cover and let rise until puffy, about 1 hour.
  - "Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 20–25 minutes, then reduce to 350°F (180°C) for 10–15 more minutes. The cake should be golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped."
  - Once cooled, decorate with glaze and colored sugar.

King Cake is a celebration of tradition and community. In New Orleans, people eat it from January 6, known as Epiphany. This day celebrates when the three wise men visited baby Jesus. They continue eating it until Mardi Gras. A plastic baby is inside, bringing luck and prosperity to the lucky person.

Today, there are many variations, like cinnamon-sugar or cream cheese fillings. I kept this one traditional. It's a simple brioche dough, decorated with the symbolic colors of purple, green, and gold. Purple stands for justice, green represents faith, and gold signifies power.

Like all yeast-based baking in my household, I use a sourdough starter. It adds depth and tang, and it’s a practical choice since I already have the starter.

Make it your own. While I kept it simple, feel free to add fillings like cinnamon-sugar, jam, or cream cheese. You can also knead cinnamon into the dough.

Baking is about enjoying the process. Your dough might not rise as expected, or the glaze could be messy. That’s all part of it. Every time you bake, you gain skills and confidence. You also create traditions that last with you and your loved ones.

## Instructions

### **1. Feed Your Starter**
A few days before baking, feed your starter to ensure it’s bubbly and active. Store it at room temperature until ready to use.

### **2. Make the Dough**
Warm the milk and 85 g (6 tbsp) of butter in a small saucepan or microwave. Let it cool slightly.

Add the egg, egg yolks, sourdough starter, and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix to combine using the paddle attachment. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the warm milk mixture. Add the flour and salt, mixing until a rough dough forms, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Cover with a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.

### **3. Knead the Dough**
Switch to the dough hook and knead on medium-low speed for about 6 to 8 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and slightly tacky but pulling away from the sides of the bowl. If it’s too sticky, sprinkle a bit more flour to adjust the consistency. You’ll notice that it’s a richer dough with more structure due to the added butter and eggs.

### **4. Bulk Rise**
Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 8 to 10 hours (or overnight).

### **5. Shape the Dough**
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.

Gently remove the dough onto a lightly oiled surface and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Roll the dough into a large rectangle, about 15 x 10 inches (38 x 25 cm). Roll it into a tight log, seam side down. Transfer to your prepared sheet pan, shaping it into a ring. Let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes to firm up.

### **6. Second Rise**
Brush the surface and sides of the dough with melted butter. Cover and let rest until noticeably puffy, about 1 hour.

### **7. Bake the Brioche**
Place the cake in the preheated oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown. Reduce the heat to 350°F (180°C) and continue baking for another 10 to 15 minutes. The cake should be golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped.

### **8. Decorate & Serve**
Once the cake has cooled, you can decorate it with a glaze and colored sugar.

## How to Make Colored Sugar

2. Stir until the sugar is evenly colored. You can also shake the sugar and food coloring together in a small resealable bag.
3. Let it dry for 10 minutes before using.

## How to Make the Glaze
1. In a small bowl, whisk together 120 g (1 cup) powdered sugar with 1–2 tbsp milk or heavy cream to reach your desired consistency.
2. Add 1 tsp of vanilla extract for flavor.
3. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake.
