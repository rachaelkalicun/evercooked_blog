# Sourdough Beignets: A Classic with Depth

Beignets are a staple in New Orleans, a deep-fried delight dusted in powdered sugar. They're tied to the city's café culture, best enjoyed with a strong cup of coffee. While typically made with commercial yeast, using a sourdough starter brings depth and a slight tang, balancing the sweetness.

This version follows a long fermentation process, developing flavor overnight. The dough is light yet structured, yielding crisp edges and a soft, airy center. If you have a bubbly, active starter, you’re already halfway there.

Beignets are best when shared. They remind us that good things take time and effort, but the result is always worth it.

## Ingredients

- 120 g (1/2 cup) milk, warm
- 100 g (1/2 cup) active sourdough starter
- 1 large egg
- 30 g (2 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted

- Powdered sugar, for dusting

## Instructions

### **1. Mix the Dough**
In a large bowl, whisk the warm milk, sourdough starter, egg, melted butter, and sugar. Add the flour and salt, mixing until a sticky dough forms. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.

### **2. Knead & Bulk Ferment**
Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 5 minutes. Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise overnight (8–12 hours) at room temperature until doubled.

### **3. Shape & Proof**
Roll the dough to about 1/4 inch thick on a floured surface. Cut into 2-inch squares and place on a parchment-lined tray. Cover and let proof for 1–2 hours until puffy.

### **4. Fry the Beignets**
Heat oil to 350°F (175°C) (or test oil temperature by adding a tiny bit of doug) in a heavy-bottomed pot. Fry beignets in batches, about 1–2 minutes per side, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.

### **5. Finish & Serve**
Dust generously with powdered sugar and enjoy warm. Best eaten fresh, with café au lait à la Café du Monde.
