Beignets are a beloved part of New Orleans' culinary tradition, and they are best enjoyed alongside a cup of chicory-laced [café au lait](/blog/cafe-au-lait) with loved ones. They are traditionally made with commercial yeast, but using a sourdough starter adds a layer of depth and a subtle tang that balances the sweetness. The result is a light yet structured dough, with crisp edges and a soft, airy center.

## Ingredients

- 120 g (1/2 cup) warm milk
- 100 g (1/2 cup) active sourdough starter
- 1 large egg
- 30 g (2 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted
- 30 g (2 tbsp) sugar
- 240 g (2 cups) all-purpose flour
- 3 g (1/2 tsp) salt
- Neutral oil, for frying

- Powdered sugar, for dusting

## Instructions

### **1. Mix the Dough**
In a mixer, mix the warm milk, sourdough starter, egg, melted butter, and sugar. Add the flour and salt, mixing until a sticky dough forms. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.

### **2. Knead & Bulk Rise**
Knead on medium-low speed for about 6 to 8 minutes or until the dough separates from the sides and bottom of the bowl. Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise 8–10 hours (or overnight) at room temperature until doubled in size.

### **3. Shape & Proof**
Roll the dough to about 1/4 inch thick on a floured surface. Cut into 2-inch squares or diamonds and place on a floured or parchment-lined tray. Cover and let proof for 1–2 hours until puffy.

### **4. Fry the Beignets**
Heat oil to 350°F (175°C) (or test the temperature by adding a tiny piece of dough) in a heavy-bottomed pot. Fry beignets in batches, about 1–2 minutes per side, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.

### **5. Finish & Serve**
Generously dust with powdered sugar and enjoy warm. Best eaten fresh with a [café au lait](/blog/cafe-au-lait), just like at Café du Monde.
