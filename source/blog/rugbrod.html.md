ingredients:
  - 262g (1 1/3 cup) sourdough starter, bubbly and active
  - 630g (2 1/2 cup) warm water (about 90°F/32°C)
  - 35g (1 3/4 tbsp) unsulphured molasses
  - 368g (4 cups) rye flour
  - 315g (2 1/2 cup) bread flour or all-purpose flour with 36g vital wheat gluten
  - 53g rye flakes (optional)
  - 9g (1.75 tsp) salt
  - 105g (3/4 cup) sunflower seeds
  - 105g (3/4 cup) pumpkin seeds
  - 52g (1/3 cup) sliced almonds
  - 78g (1/3 cup) flax seeds
  - 35g (3.5 tbsp) sesame seeds
cuisine: Danish, Scandinavian

instructions:
  - In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the sourdough starter, warm water, and molasses. Mix briefly to dissolve.
  - Add the rye flour, bread flour (or all-purpose flour with vital wheat gluten), rye flakes (if using), and salt. Using the dough hook, mix on low speed until the ingredients come together into a rough dough, about 3-4 minutes.
  - Increase the speed to medium and knead the dough for 6-8 minutes. The dough will be sticky.
  - Add the sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, and sesame seeds. Mix on low speed for another 1-2 minutes to incorporate.
  - Cover the dough and let it rise at room temperature for 24 hours.
  - Lightly oil a 13 x 4-inch Pullman pan, including the lid. Transfer the dough into the pan, smoothing the top with a damp spatula. Sprinkle extra seeds on top for decoration.
  - Cover the pan and let the dough rise for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the dough reaches just below the top of the pan.
  - Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
  - Slide the lid onto the Pullman pan. Bake the bread with the lid on for 30 minutes.
  - Take the lid off and bake the bread for an additional 50-60 minutes until golden brown, firm to the touch, and is pulling away from the sides of the pan.
  - Let the bread cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.

Rugbrød is a traditional Danish rye bread. It's dense, earthy, and sour, making it the perfect base for smørrebrød, Danish open-faced sandwiches. Butter is essential ("smør" means butter, after all), but the other toppings are up to you. You can go the traditional route with pickled herring or sliced meats and cheeses, or you can put your own creative spin on it. Either way, it's a timeless way to honor tradition. You can find both traditional and modern ideas for smørrebrød [here](/blog/beet-salmon-potato-egg-smorrebrod).

This bread is baked in a Pullman pan, specifically a [13x4-inch Pullman pan](https://www.amazon.com/USA-Pan-Bakeware-Nonstick-Aluminized/dp/B002UNMZPI/ref=sr_1_1){:target="_blank"}, which gives it its rectangular shape. The straight sides and lid help create the uniform slices that make it perfect for smørrebrød. If you wanted to use a standard loaf pan instead, reduce the recipe by about 1.75 times to fit properly.

Like any new recipe or tradition, making rugbrød takes patience, and there may be moments of trial and error. Every mistake is a chance to learn, and every loaf that turns out right feels like a small victory.

Whether you're new to baking or an experienced cook, I hope this recipe inspires you to try it. Don’t stress about perfection. Celebrate the journey. If you run into challenges, remember it’s all part of the process. I’m here cheering you on every step of the way.

## Instructions

### **1. Prepare the Dough**
In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the sourdough starter, warm water, and molasses. Mix briefly to dissolve. Add the rye flour, all-purpose flour, vital wheat gluten, rye flakes (if using), and salt.

### **2. Knead the Dough**
Using the dough hook, mix on low speed for 3-4 minutes until the dough comes together. Increase the speed to medium and knead for 6-8 minutes. The dough will be sticky but smooth.

### **3. Add the Seeds**
Add the sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, and sesame seeds (or your choice of seeds/nuts). Mix to incorporate.

### **4. First Rise**
Cover the dough and let it rise at room temperature for 24 hours. It should become bubbly and slightly puffy.

### **5. Prepare the Pan**
Lightly oil a 13 x 4-inch Pullman pan. Transfer the dough to the pan and smooth the top with a damp spatula. Sprinkle extra seeds on top if desired.

### **6. Second Rise**
Cover the pan and let the dough rise for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until it reaches just below the top of the pan.

### **7. Bake the Bread**
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Slide the lid onto the Pullman pan. Bake the bread with the lid on for 30 minutes. Take the lid off and bake the bread for an additional 50-60 minutes until golden brown, firm to the touch, and is pulling away from the sides of the pan.

### **8. Cool and Slice**
Let the bread cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.

### Notes & Tips
**Seed Customization:** Feel free to swap out the seeds for different types (hemp, sunflower, etc.), but aim to keep the total weight around 375g.

**Texture & Slicing:** This bread is moist and dense. For the best slices, let it cool completely before cutting. Use a serrated knife and slice thinly.

**Measure the Temperature:** At the end of the baking time, I measure the middle of the bread to make sure it is at least 190°F (88°C). This is an easy way to make sure your bread is cooked thoroughly. This is the [thermometer I have](https://www.amazon.com/ThermoPro-Digital-Instant-Thermometer-Kitchen/dp/B01IHHLB3W/ref=sr_1_5){:target="_blank"}.
