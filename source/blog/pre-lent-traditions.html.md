The days leading up to Lent are a time of indulgence, preparation, and, for many, a last hurrah before the season of reflection begins. Across cultures, the pre-Lenten period is marked by food traditions that bring people together in celebration. For me, this time is tied to memories of Mardi Gras and Shrove Tuesday, two different but equally rich traditions that remind me how food carries both history and meaning.

Mardi Gras, with its parades, beads, and revelry, is more than just a party. At its heart, it’s a communal experience, a moment when food, music, and history intertwine. The smell of king cake—sweet, spiced, and often filled with cream cheese or praline—lingers in the air. There’s something special about slicing into one, hoping to find the tiny plastic baby hidden inside. Some might see it as a fun novelty, but to me, it’s a quiet reminder of continuity: whoever finds the baby hosts the next gathering, ensuring the tradition lives on.

Then comes Shrove Tuesday, a softer, homier ritual. In contrast to the exuberance of Mardi Gras, this day is about using up what’s left—flour, butter, eggs—before the fasting season begins. Pancakes take center stage, light and golden, sometimes doused in syrup or sprinkled with sugar and lemon. It’s a simple meal, but it carries weight. Flipping pancakes in the kitchen, watching batter turn to something warm and nourishing, I think of the generations before me who did the same, their own hands mixing and flipping, making sure nothing went to waste.

These traditions, though different in their energy, share a common thread: food as a bridge. They connect past to present, family to community, indulgence to discipline. Whether it’s the vibrant joy of Mardi Gras or the quiet reflection of Shrove Tuesday, both are reminders that food is never just food—it’s history, it’s ritual, it’s love and legacy.

As Evercooked grows, I think about these moments and how many of us have stories like this—meals that mark time, recipes passed down, dishes that say more than words ever could. Maybe you have a pre-Lent tradition too, whether it’s a feast, a favorite dish, or a simple ritual in your kitchen. I’d love to hear about it. Share your story using #TraditionAndTable, and let’s celebrate the meals that tie us to something bigger than ourselves.
