Café au lait in New Orleans is more than just coffee with milk. It’s a tradition. During the Civil War, the French Creole community in New Orleans began adding chicory to coffee when it was in short supply, stretching the coffee and making it last longer. Over time, this became a part of the city’s coffee culture, especially in places like Café du Monde, where it’s still added.

For my own version of this tradition, I use half coffee and half roasted chicory. I also serve it in a bowl like in France.

## Ingredients

- 3 tbsp coarsely ground coffee
- 3 tbsp roasted chicory
- 2 cups water
- 1 cup whole milk
- 1–2 tbsp sugar (optional)

## Instructions

### **1. Brew the Coffee**
Mix the ground coffee and chicory in a French press. Boil the water and pour it over the grounds. Stir gently and steep for 4 minutes before pressing.

### **2. Warm the Milk**
Heat the milk in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in sugar if using, dissolving it completely. Just before it reaches a simmer, remove from heat.

### **3. Combine & Serve**
