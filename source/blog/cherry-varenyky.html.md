ingredients:
  - 2 cups (255 g) all-purpose flour, preferably unbleached (plus more as needed)
  - 1 tsp salt (6 g)
  - 3 tbsp (42 g) unsalted butter
  - 3/4 cup (180 ml) water
  - Frozen pitted cherries (about 80, two per dumpling)
  - Sugar, for serving (optional)
  - Sour cream or crème fraîche, for serving
cuisine: Ukrainian

instructions:
  - In a stand mixer, whisk the flour and salt.
  - Heat the butter and water together until the butter melts.
  - Pour into the flour and mix with a dough hook until smooth. If you don’t have a stand mixer, you can knead the dough by hand. It will take about 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover the dough and let it rest at room temperature for about 1 hour.
  - Divide the dough into small pieces and roll it through a pasta machine, gradually reducing thickness until the third-thinnest setting. No pasta roller? You can roll out the dough by hand using a rolling pin. Just aim for a thin, even sheet, about the thickness of fresh pasta.
  - Cut into 3-inch rounds using a cookie cutter or glass.
  - Place 2 frozen cherries in each round. Moisten one half of the edge with water and press to seal.
  - Place varenyky on a baking sheet sprayed with oil and freeze if not boiling immediately. Boil for 5 minutes or until they float and are tender.
  - Serve warm with sour cream or crème fraîche. Top with sugar or additional cherries if desired.

These cherry varenyky are a sweet version of a Ukrainian classic: soft dumplings like Polish pierogi, folded by hand and filled with fruit. Varenyky are an important part of the _Sviat Vechir_ (Holy Supper) Christmas Eve meal, a night rooted in quiet joy and reflection.

For years, I only made savory varenyky, but more recently, I’ve added cherry to the mix. It's a small way of honoring the past while making room for something new. That’s at the heart of what Evercooked is all about.

The dough is simple: flour, salt, water, and butter. I use a stand mixer and pasta roller, but hand-kneading and rolling works just as well.

I freeze big batches at Christmas so there’s always some on hand. This recipe makes about 40 dumplings, and the dough is just as good with savory fillings like potato and cheese. Once you’ve made the dough, you can take it in any direction you want.

{: .mb-0 }

- 2 cups (255 g) all-purpose flour, preferably unbleached
- 1 tsp salt (6 g)
- 3 tbsp (42 g) unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup (180 ml) water

## How to Make Cherry Varenyky

### **1. Make the Dough**
In a stand mixer, whisk the flour and salt. Heat the butter and water together until the butter melts. Pour into the flour and mix with a dough hook until smooth. If you don’t have a stand mixer, you can knead the dough by hand. It will take about 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover the dough and let it rest at room temperature for about 1 hour.

### **2. Roll and Cut**
Divide the dough into small pieces and roll it through a pasta machine, gradually reducing thickness until the third-thinnest setting. No pasta roller? You can roll out the dough by hand using a rolling pin. Just aim for a thin, even sheet, about the thickness of fresh pasta. Cut into 3-inch rounds using a cookie cutter or glass.
